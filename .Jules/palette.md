## 2024-05-14 - Accessibility Pass: Icon-only buttons
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where core navigational and modal close buttons (e.g., `TopBar`, `Modal`, `QRScanner`) relied solely on Lucide React icons (`<X />`, `<Menu />`) without `aria-label`s, rendering them unannounced to screen readers.
**Action:** Always verify that buttons containing only icons receive an appropriate `aria-label` attribute (e.g., "Close modal", "Toggle menu") for improved accessibility.
